# 🚗 💨 💨 SLIPSCREAM 🚗 💨 💨

I recently fell in love with a retro-inspired racing car game named [Slipstream](https://slipstre.am/).

Retrogaming is one of my passions, and I'm fascinated by how engineers had develop so great games with so low hardware resources.

So let's try to do something similar with a simple game to better try to understand these challenges!

This project is my first attempt at messing up with C# with the wise guidance of one of the best C# developers in the world: [@rodolfotedeschi](https://github.com/rodolfotedeschi).

## 💻 Recommended IDE Setup

The recommended IDE setup is [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

A more lightweight editor could be [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

To improve the development experience with `VSCode`, the installation of the following extensions is recommended:

- [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)

- [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) (to collab!)

- [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) (or use the native VSCode functionality)
- [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)
- [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight)
